# Dry::Types::Rails

Really simple gem that will help you work with the [`dry-types`](https://github.com/dryrb/dry-types) gem in development.

## Raison d'Ãªtre

Rails reloads code quite often in development, this broke the usage of `Dry::Data` since it would register the same types multiple times and raise exceptions.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'dry-types-rails'
```

## Usage

Nothing to do, this is using `Rails::Railtie`, which means it gets loaded automatically.
