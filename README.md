# Dry::Types::Rails

Really simple gem that will help you work with the [`dry-types`](https://github.com/dryrb/dry-types) gem in development.

## Current status: EXPERIMENTAL

This gem currently "works for me", but as of right now I'm sure there are a number of edge cases that haven't been hit yet.  As those occur, please report them so I can add specs to test them.

## Raison d'Ãªtre

Rails reloads code quite often in development, this broke the usage of `Dry::Types` since it would register the same types multiple times and raise exceptions.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'dry-types-rails', group: :development
```

Note that it should __only__ be included in your development environment.

## Usage

Nothing to do, this is using `Rails::Railtie`, which means it gets loaded automatically.
